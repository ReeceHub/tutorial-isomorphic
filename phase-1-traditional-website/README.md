# Phase 1 - Build a traditional website

## Getting started

As in every phase we will use this directory as working directory.
We're going to create a docker compose file and the minimal folder structure.

### Create the host folder for our project

``` shell
# execute on the host
mkdir frontend
```
I plan to use multiple docker containers and this will be our frontend
application container.


### Create Docker file
[reference](https://docs.docker.com)

Create a file called `frontend/Dockerfile`.

``` Dockerfile
FROM node:alpine

ENV SRC_PATH=/usr/src/frontend
ENV BUILD_PATH=/var/lib/frontend
ENV EXPOSED=8080
EXPOSE $EXPOSED

RUN mkdir -p $SRC_PATH
RUN mkdir -p $BUILD_PATH
RUN ln -s $SRC_PATH/node_modules/ $BUILD_PATH/node_modules

WORKDIR $SRC_PATH

CMD ["ash"]
```

### Create Docker Compose file

[reference](https://docs.docker.com/compose/)

Create a docker compose file: `docker-compose.yml`

``` yaml
version: "3"
services:
  tutorial-frontend:
    container_name: tutorial-frontend
    image: tutorial-frontend
    build:
      context: frontend/
    ports:
      - "8080:8080"
    volumes:
      - "data:/usr/src/frontend/node_modules"
      - "./frontend:/usr/src/frontend"
volumes:
  data:
```

### Build our very first image

``` shell
# execute on the host
docker-compose build
```

### Start our container

``` shell
# execute on the host
docker-compose run --service-ports --rm tutorial-frontend ash
```

At this point we have an up and running node environment.
Let's test the following commands just to understand which version of
NodeJS we have.

``` bash
# execute inside the container
node --version
# output: v8.1.3

npm --version
# output: 5.0.3
```

If you see a version which is older than those, please pull the
latest `alpine:node` and build your `tutorial-frontend` image again.

``` bash
# execute on the host
docker pull node:alpine
```

Every command from this point will be executed inside the docker container
that we've just started.

### Create our project

In this section we will create a `package.json` file which contain information
about our project including the dependencies.

With the following command you can create the `package.json`. If you omit the
`-y` flag `npm` will ask a few question about the project.

``` bash
# execute inside the container
npm init -y
```

Since we've mapped our local folder to the working directory inside our
container we can see and edit the files outside.

## Create a static website

In this section we are going to create a simple
(Express)[https://expressjs.com/] web server which only suppose to serve
our static HTML files and the related resources.

### Install express js via npm

``` bash
# execute inside the container
npm install --save express
```
The command above install the web application framework and also save
the dependency in our project `package.json` file.

### Build our first website

First thing to do is create a folder our publicly available files and copy
those resources there.

``` bash
# execute on the host

# Create a folder for public files
mkdir -p frontend/public

cp -R ../html/* frontend/public/
```

Now we are going to create the server code.

``` bash
# execute on the host
mkdir -p frontend/server
```

Create a file inside our `server` folder, called `main.js`.

``` javascript
const express = require('express');
const app = express();

app.use(express.static('public'));

export default app;
```

And create a file next to it, called `serve.js`.

``` javascript
import app from './main';

app.listen(8080, function () {
  console.log('Example app listening on port 8080!');
});
```

### Let's do a manual test

``` bash
# execute inside the container
node server/serve.js
```

Click on the following link: http://localhost:8080/

That's great that works ;)

The last missing step which come very handy later is tweak our `package.json`
to manage the application startup. Replace the dummy test script with
something more useful (at the moment)

``` diff
  "scripts": {
-    "test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1"
+    "start": "node server/serve.js"
  },

```

Repeat our manual test:

``` bash
# execute inside the container
npm run start
```

## Use latest JavaScript features

Let's modify our JavaScript server code a bit.

``` diff
- const express = require('express');
+ import express from 'express';
+
const app = express();

app.use(express.static('public'));

app.listen(8080, function () {
  console.log('Example app listening on port 8080!')
});
```

if we restart our server application it will fail to start.

``` bash
# execute inside the container
npm run start
```

### Install babel to compile our code

[Babel](http://babeljs.io) is a pluggable javascript compiler.
You could read more [about babel plugins](http://babeljs.io/docs/plugins/).

``` shell
# execution inside the container
npm install --save babel-cli babel-preset-env babel-preset-stage-0
```

If we change the `package.json` file again, we can use babel.


``` diff
  "scripts": {
-    "start": "node server/serve.js"
+    "start": "babel-node server/serve.js"
  },
```

Start the server again and see what we have on http://localhost:8080/

``` bash
# execute inside the container
npm run start
```

However it's already good enough, we have to make sure we can use every
feature that we want. So add a babel configuration to our project
configuration.

"babel": {"presets": ["env", "stage-0"]}
``` diff
  "scripts": {
    "start": "babel-node server/serve.js"
  },
+  "babel": {"presets": ["env", "stage-0"]},
```

We will improve that configuration later.

## Improve our Dockerfile

``` diff
RUN ln -s $SRC_PATH/node_modules/ $BUILD_PATH/node_modules

WORKDIR $SRC_PATH

+ COPY package.json .
+
+ RUN npm install
+
+ COPY . .
+
- CMD ["ash"]
+ CMD ["npm", "run", "start"]
```

Let's rebuild our image and start the container again.

``` shell
# execute on the host

docker-compose build

docker-compose run --service-ports --rm tutorial-frontend
```

## Create a test to check whether our HTML generated well

``` shell
# execution inside the container
npm install --save-dev mocha chai chai-http sinon
```

I found some bug when I started to run the real tests later. Workaround
is simple, just install the following packages as well.

``` shell
# execution inside the container
npm install --save-dev combined-stream delayed-stream
```

``` shell
# execute on the host
mkdir frontend/test
```

Create a sanity test, create a file fronted/test/sanity.js

``` javascript
import assert from 'assert';
describe('Array', function() {
  describe('#indexOf()', function() {
    it('should return -1 when the value is not present', function() {
      assert.equal(-1, [1,2,3].indexOf(4));
    });
  });
});
```

Finally extend our `package.json` to be able to execute the test.

``` diff
  "scripts": {
    "start": "babel-node server/serve.js",
+     "test": "mocha --compilers js:babel-core/register"
  },
```

``` shell
# execution inside the container
npm test
```

So far we didn't do any useful, so let's create a test against our page.

Let's create a more useful test. Let's check whether the app is became
available, so create a file in out test folder called `highLevelTest.js`.
In this file we will write some high level assertion to make sure
the HTML rendered well for each endpoint.
We won't test much functionality just, some piece of expected content.


``` javascript
import chai from 'chai';
import chaiHttp from 'chai-http';

import app from '../server/main';


const expect = chai.expect;

chai.use(chaiHttp);


describe('App', function() {
  describe('/', function() {
    it('responds with status 200', function(done) {
      chai.request(app)
        .get('/')
        .end(function(err, res) {
          expect(res).to.have.status(200);
          done();
        });
    });
    it('response contains expected title', function(done) {
      chai.request(app)
        .get('/')
        .end(function(err, res) {
          expect(res.text).to.have.string('ADR database');
          done();
        });
    });
  });
  describe('/submit', function() {
    it('responds with status 200', function(done) {
      chai.request(app)
        .get('/submit.html')
        .end(function(err, res) {
          expect(res).to.have.status(200);
          done();
        });
    });
    it('response contains expected title', function(done) {
      chai.request(app)
        .get('/submit.html')
        .end(function(err, res) {
          expect(res.text).to.have.string('Create new decision record');
          done();
        });
    });
  });
  describe('/view', function() {
    it('responds with status 200', function(done) {
      chai.request(app)
        .get('/view.html')
        .end(function(err, res) {
          expect(res).to.have.status(200);
          done();
        });
    });
    it('response contains expected title', function(done) {
      chai.request(app)
        .get('/view.html')
        .end(function(err, res) {
          expect(res.text).to.have.string('Conclusion');
          done();
        });
    });
  });
});
```

At this point we can remove out sanity test.

## Improve our Dockerfile again, include tests in the build

``` diff
RUN npm install

COPY . .
+
+ RUN npm test

CMD ["npm", "run", "start"]
```

## Split up the code

The last part of this tutorial is a small refactoring, we create
3 endpoints for each page. As you can expect, we start modify our tests.

Please modify the tests, remove every `.html` extension from the URLs

### Install ejs
[ejs](http://ejs.co/) which is a simple template library that we can use.
There are many more popular template engine for express, however we don't
need much feature. This is mainly an intermediate stage, we will barely use
templates later.

``` shell
# execution inside the container
npm install --save ejs
```


### Create different endpoints

Extend our `main.js` as it follows:

``` javascript
const express = require('express');
const app = express();


app.get('/', function (req, res) {
  res.send('Hello World!');
});


app.get('/submit', function (req, res) {
  res.send('Hello World!');
});


app.get('/view', function (req, res) {
  res.send('Hello World!');
});


app.use(express.static('public'));

export default app;
```

If we test our application again, one type of error solved after removing
the `.html` suffixes, we get `200` responses from the app.


### Introduce the templates

First of all, we need to create a folder for our templates then
move our html file to the place. We also rename them, set `.ejs` as extension.

``` shell
mkdir frontend/server/templates
mv frontend/public/index.html frontend/server/templates/index.ejs
mv frontend/public/submit.html frontend/server/templates/submit.ejs
mv frontend/public/view.html frontend/server/templates/view.ejs
```

The final version of our `main.js` file the following:

``` javascript
import path from 'path';

import express from 'express';


const app = express();

const TEMPLATE_PATH = path.join(process.env.SRC_PATH, 'server', 'templates');

app.set('view engine', 'ejs');
app.set('views', TEMPLATE_PATH);

app.get('/', function (req, res) {
  res.render('index');
});


app.get('/submit', function (req, res) {
  res.render('submit');
});


app.get('/view', function (req, res) {
  res.render('view');
});

app.use(express.static('public'));

export default app;
```

Tests should pass


### Fix links in the html files

The last piece to fix is replacing the links, referring pages without `.html`
suffix. I'm not going to show that, however you will find them as a base
in the folder of the next chapter.


Well done. If you've reached this point, you have a solid base code.
