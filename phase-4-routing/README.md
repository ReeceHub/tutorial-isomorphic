# Routing properly

We will have to fix the routing as we want React to control the different
URLs, we will use [React-Router](https://reacttraining.com/react-router/).

This step is an important preparation towards client side rendering.

## Recap

Build the docker image
``` shell
# execute on the host
docker-compose build
```

Start container, http://localhost:8080/
``` shell
# execute on the host
docker-compose run --service-ports --rm tutorial-frontend
```

Enter to the container, to be able to execute commands in it
``` shell
# execute on the host
docker-compose run --service-ports --rm tutorial-frontend ash
```

Start the application
``` shell
# execute inside the container
npm run start
```

Execute tests
``` shell
# execute inside the container
npm run test
```

Check coding guidelines
``` shell
# execute inside the container
npm run lint
```
