# Client side rendering

This chapter will show how can we use both client and server side
rendering together. It might be an intense topic as well as
we have to start using [webpack](https://webpack.js.org/).

## Recap

Build the docker image
``` shell
# execute on the host
docker-compose build
```

Start container, http://localhost:8080/
``` shell
# execute on the host
docker-compose run --service-ports --rm tutorial-frontend
```

Enter to the container, to be able to execute commands in it
``` shell
# execute on the host
docker-compose run --service-ports --rm tutorial-frontend ash
```

Start the application
``` shell
# execute inside the container
npm run start
```

Execute tests
``` shell
# execute inside the container
npm run test
```

Check coding guidelines
``` shell
# execute inside the container
npm run lint
```

## What is this topic about

So far we render every component on the server side responding to the request.
This is the traditional way to build an application. This is essential
if we want to be visible for search engines. But it has a downside as well.
Our users have to download the whole page every time when they visit any
of our pages, even if just the small part of the page get changed.
With client side rendering we can provide smooth experience to our users.

## Setup webpack

The first thing to do is install webpack and a bunch of plugins.

``` shell
# execute inside the container
npm install --save webpack babel-loader
```

Modify our `package.json` add the builder script:

``` diff
  "scripts": {
+   "build": "webpack --progress",
    "start": "babel-node server/serve.js",
    "test": "mocha --compilers js:babel-core/register",
    "lint": "eslint . --ext .js,.jsx",
    "lint:fix": "eslint . --ext .js,.jsx --fix"
  },
```

We also have to create a `webpack.config.js` file:

``` javascript
const path = require('path');
const webpack = require('webpack');

const BUILD_PATH = process.env.BUILD_PATH;
const SRC_PATH = process.env.SRC_PATH;


module.exports = {
  entry: path.resolve(SRC_PATH, 'client', 'application.jsx'),
  output: {
    path: path.resolve(BUILD_PATH, 'build'),
    filename: 'application.bundle.js'
  },
  module: {
    loaders: [
      {
        test: /\.jsx?$/,
        loader: 'babel-loader',
        exclude: /node_modules/
      }
    ]
  },
  stats: {
    colors: true
  },
  resolve: {
    extensions: ['.js', '.jsx'],
    modules: [
      path.resolve(SRC_PATH, 'client'),
      'node_modules'
    ]
  },
  devtool: 'source-map'
};
```


Create the client side application `client/application.jsx`:

``` jsx
import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';
import { BrowserRouter } from 'react-router-dom';
import { renderRoutes } from 'react-router-config';

import routes from './routes';


const Application = () => (
  <BrowserRouter>
    {renderRoutes(routes)}
  </BrowserRouter>
);


ReactDOM.render(<Application/>, document.getElementById('application'));
```

Modify our template file to be able to use the bundle:

``` diff
  <body>
-   <div id="Application"><%- Application %></div>
+   <div id="application"><%- Application %></div>
+   <script src="application.bundle.js"></script>
  </body>
```

I also had to fix a small issue, for some reason if the id of the host
element starts with a capital letter, React raises an error.

Modify our `main.js` to be able to access the bundle from client side:

``` diff
  const TEMPLATE_PATH = path.join(process.env.SRC_PATH, 'server', 'templates');
+ const BUILD_PATH = path.join(process.env.BUILD_PATH, 'build');

  app.set('view engine', 'ejs');
  app.set('views', TEMPLATE_PATH);

  app.use(express.static('public'));
+ app.use(express.static(BUILD_PATH));

  app.get('*', (req, res) => {
```

If we reload our application, we shouldn't see any error on console.
Open the Network tab in the developer toolbar, and see what's happening.

First, change pages be clicking the Home and the Submit buttons on top.
If you followed me correctly, you would see nothing in the Network tab.

But if you clicked anywhere else, you would see the whole page reload.
The reason is, because we use direct links (`<a href="...">...</a>`) to
navigate.

### Reloading issue

In the next section, we are going to fix the links, basically
refactoring our client side code. However it isn't enough to restart
the application anymore. Unfortunately we have to rebuild it every time.

``` shell
# execute inside the container
npm run build
```

We will fix that in this chapter, but use this way for now.


## Fix navigation everywhere

This topic is mainly an exercise, I will show a few example but you
have to fix the code on your own.

We have to use
[&lt;Link&gt;](https://reacttraining.com/react-router/web/api/Link)


### Fix Navigation

``` diff
  import React from 'react';
  import { NavLink } from 'react-router-dom';
+ import { Link } from 'react-router-dom';

  const Navigation = () => (
    <nav className="navbar navbar-inverse navbar-static-top">
        ...
+         <Link to="/" className="navbar-brand">ADR Database</Link>
-         <a className="navbar-brand" href="/">ADR database</a>
        </div>
        ...
      </div>
    </nav>
  );

  export default Navigation;
```

You can left the search form as it is, we will fix that later.

### Fix Archive Module

``` diff
  import React from 'react';
+ import { Link } from 'react-router-dom';

  const ArchiveModule = () => (
    <div className="sidebar-module">
      <h4>Archives</h4>
      <ol className="list-unstyled">
-       <li><a href="/?byDate=2017-03">March 2017</a></li>
-       <li><a href="/?byDate=2017-02">February 2017</a></li>
-       <li><a href="/?byDate=2017-01">January 2017</a></li>
+       <li><Link to="/?byDate=2017-03">March 2017</Link></li>
+       <li><Link to="/?byDate=2017-02">February 2017</Link></li>
+       <li><Link to="/?byDate=2017-01">January 2017</Link></li>
      </ol>
    </div>
  );

  export default ArchiveModule;
```

### Fix Excerpt

``` diff
  import React from 'react';
+ import { Link } from 'react-router-dom';

  const Excerpt = () => (
    <article className="Adr">
      <header>
-       <h2 className="Adr-title"><a href="/view">Sample decision</a></h2>
-       <p className="Adr-meta"><a className="app-adr-code" href="/view">ADR-0001</a> January 1, 2014 by <a href="#">Mark</a></p>
+       <h2 className="Adr-title"><Link to="/view">Sample decision</Link></h2>
+       <p className="Adr-meta"><Link className="app-adr-code" to="/view">ADR-0001</Link> January 1, 2014 by <a href="#">Mark</a></p>
      </header>
      ...
      <footer>
-       <a href="/view">Read more</a>
+       <Link href="/view">Read more</Link>
      </footer>
    </article>
  );

export default Excerpt;
```

You can fix the rest, but as we work we will fix the them.

## Differentiate production and development build

However it works well so far but there a few issue here.
First of all, the bundle code is way too detailed, lots of comments there.
We want to have the small as possible bundle.

The other issue is, when we deploy a new version our users have to download
the latest bundle otherwise the application won't work.

Lucky us, webpack has an excellent solution for that.


## Hot reload
