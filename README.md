# How to build a React + Redux Isomorphic website

## Disclaimer

I'm not a NodeJS or React expert. I built many websites with JavaScript
but it was back in the stone age, when I used HTML (not HTML5) and JQuery.
That's very likely you will find better, easier or quicker solutions for
the demonstrated problem.

### Prerequisite

You should know how to use Docker (and Compose) and have minimal knowledge
of HTML, CSS and Javascript.

#### Technical prerequisite

We will use Docker and Docker Compose. You should have the most recent
version installed. I did everything on MacOS (using Docker-Mac) but I
believe everything should work just fine on Linux or Windows.
