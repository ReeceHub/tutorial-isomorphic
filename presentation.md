# Introduction

## Disclaimer

I'm not an expert

## My Motivation

I wanted to build a simple frontend for my Machine Learning app.
I've asked one of my colleague, who said React. I had minimal experience
with Angular (very minimal), and a very rusty JS knowledge.
I haven't find good end-to-end tutorial.

## It's a big topic

I wanted to give you a complete zero-to-hero style tutorial.
Along the way I have to explain Node, Babel, Webpack, Express, React,
Redux and 10+ plugins and solutions.
It won't fit in one day :(

## Node

It's a crazy really fast evolving environment. I had many issues,
which went away since I've solved

## What we are doing

- Build a traditional (server side rendered website)
- Use React to break down pages (still server side)
- Make React responsible for routing
- Client Side Rendering (finally ;) )
- Redux for data management

## What do you need to know

Please have a docker and docker-compose installed on your machine.
Minimal Javascript knowledge is enough.

## Feel free to correct me

As I mentioned I'm not an expert. I started learning the whole thing
3 months ago.

## How we are doing?

We will create every file by hand. Please checkout my github repository
and work inside the `phase-x...` folders. In every phase will contain
the code of the previous one.
