# Client side rendering

This chapter will show how can we use both client and server side
rendering together. It might be an intense topic as well as
we have to start using [webpack](https://webpack.js.org/).

## Recap

Build the docker image
``` shell
# execute on the host
docker-compose build
```

Start container, http://localhost:8080/
``` shell
# execute on the host
docker-compose run --service-ports --rm tutorial-frontend
```

Enter to the container, to be able to execute commands in it
``` shell
# execute on the host
docker-compose run --service-ports --rm tutorial-frontend ash
```

Start the application
``` shell
# execute inside the container
npm run start
```

Execute tests
``` shell
# execute inside the container
npm run test
```

Check coding guidelines
``` shell
# execute inside the container
npm run lint
```
